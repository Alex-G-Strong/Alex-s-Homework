This trip took place on zoom (as it were). Quite an impressive setup all things considered.


at the searsville dam, did this dam become so sedimented because of upstream logging?
a more formal ask of that question can be found at this page: [[Searsville dam and logging history in Santa Clara County]]

Also, George did an EXCELLENT job putting this together, especially given the circumstances. He could have chosen not to support the class at all, but boy did he not. And deliver as high a quality product as he could, he did!

Legend!


### Out of class exercise

##### Out-of-class exercise #1
I have attached a 1-foot contour map of the San Franciscito Creek canyon to this handout.  Use the geologic map shown in Figure 1 to locate the intersection of the faults with the surface, and mark this on the contour map.  Second, use the contour map to measure the height above the main channel that river terraces upstream and downstream of the fault occur.  

1) Use the geologic map shown in Figure 1 to locate the intersection of the faults with the surface, and mark this on the contour map.

This is VERY difficult - like too difficult, certainly for the next round of assignments I think its worth making clear how much effort should be put in. I tried to do it in QGIS, Adobe Illustrator, and Drawboard PDF to make a compelling map. I attempted to layer my PDFs and change the opacity> I pulled out the stops, and still had a TON of time sunk into a single map. I had some luck with QGIS, though I ran into issues, especially around georeferencing the base geological map PDF. I was also forced to use a 2ft contour from the EarthWorks catalogue as I could not for the life of me find a 1ft lidar interval. If you (grader or future self) know where to find one for a selected area (preferably with the ability to draw a bounding box or polygon), I would love to know. 

I have attached the PDF of the map I made. Learned my lesson on scale which is in actual units which are totally consistent throughout the map.

2) answer these questions:

a) Are elevations up- and down-stream of the fault the same, or are they different (5 points)?

I don't notice anything particularly different about the locations of the faults vs the other topography around the faults.  

b) If they are different, by how much do they vary across the fault?  (5 points)

I see no more than the 2ft contour interval that I used for the map I made. I just don't see clear faulting evidence. Maybe I totally missed it, but certainly no plain-as-day lines along where faults should be. There are certainly some creeks, and roads, but no faults.

If the fault was active, would we expect these relative heights up- and down-stream of the fault to be the same or different?  (5 points)

If the fault (the Searsville fault) was active we would expect that there would be more vertical displacement, and thus the relative heights to be different, namely that the upstream section (the one closer to the potentially-uplifted mountains) to be at a higher elevation than the lower section (towards the sediment-dumping-ground bay).

What can we say about the recent activity of these faults? (10 points)

I think from the map, we can conclude that erosion has covered topographic evidence of the fault, and thus, that the fault has not been particularly active for that period of time.



##### Out-of-class exercise #3
I have attached another 1-foot contour map of Stevens Creek Canyon to this handout.  Use this map to measure the elevation above the creek at various places downstream.  

Once again, tried and failed to download a LIDAR for the study area and got as far as the NOAA portal. I think I should be able to get it, but not quickly. Should have started earlier I guess. Would have been AWESOME to have another QGIS map in the submission, with real vector polygons, but the PDF will have to do.

a) Identify one or more river terraces, as is shown in Figure 1. (5 points) 

check! - See attached:

![[StevensCreekRiverTeraccesAnnotated.pdf]]

b) If there are more than one, denote the number of terraces you can identify, as well as their height the current river channel?  (15 points)

I found around 25 very clear river terraces (and a few not so clear ones) which were around 15' from the river course. Its hard to judge exact accuracy without a better map - or one that supports changing line weights with zooming in - but around 15' for the purple colored areas by-and-large. There are a few exceptions, which have been colored differently. 
There is also further evidence of down cutting left in upland terraces. One particularly interesting area represents ancient down cutting left on a ridge line. What a feature!

Second, use the topographic map to trace these river terraces downstream.  In several sentences, answer the following questions:

check, see the same file as above.

c) As one approaches the Monte Vista High School (map attached), do the terraces maintain their height above the active channel?  (10 points) 

The terraces, from my estimation do not remain at their upland depth. As one approaches Monta (ending with an 'a' not 'e' on google maps) Vista High School, at the bridge on StevensCreek3, the terrace depth about halves to (by my best count) about 7'.

d) If not, how do they change?  (10 points) 

The terraces decrease by about half, reducing the distance between the river bed and the terrace top from about 15' to about 7'.

e) How does this correspond with the location of the mountain front?  (5 points) 

Well, without a comprehensive geological map, and without even seeing the site myself, mapping a fault to a location is a hand-wavy exercise. With my qualification clearly stated, I would expect that the change in terrace-river bed height ( $H_t - h_r = \Delta H$ ) is roughly proportional to the distance perpendicular to the foot of the mountain building front. This implies a greater "fanning" as explained with the marine terraces between Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz. Towards the mountian building front, $\Delta H$ is large, and as one progresses a distance $d$ directly away (where $d$ is measured as the distance perpendicular to the mountain front($M_{front}$) - $d \perp M_{front}$). A graph made with $\Delta H$ on the y axis and $d$ on the x, would show a slope from higher values to lower ones. This indicates that the fault is lifting the river bed by a larger amount on the mountain side and at a lower amount on the bay side - the same process as the Marine Terraces mentioned earlier.

f) Write a brief paragraph on how the changes that you observe along the range front, the folding of the sediments observed near the dam, and the geometry of the river terraces might be related.  Do you think the range-bounding fault, called the Monte Vista Fault, is active? (20 points)

I think that the mountains are actively being built because the towards-mountain end of the river-terraces is higher than the away-from-mountain end[^1]. There also seems to be evidence that the WHOLE area has been uplifted over the course of the river's down cutting. This is particularly apparent on the ridge line I highlighted in the box on page 2. 

That being said, generally I really have no firm grasp of how much down cutting one should expect without active uplift to compare to this case with active uplift. In Central Texas, where historically the Balcones Escarpment was uplifted, the river-plateau relief is significant (much to my enjoyment as a cyclist), but the fault zone is almost entirely inactive. I imagine that the shape of the valleys tends to approach a V over time, and compared to the Central Texas river valleys the Stevens Creek river valley is more stepped, though not much more. Its just straight up hard to tell, and I lack the intuition to distinguish the landforms in this particular case. 

If you forced me to give an answer beyond "insufficient data" I would say: its likely that there is an uplift, and the stepping of the river terraces is indicative of this. I would not say this confidently because I havent seen enough riverine terraces to interpret a clear distinction on this data alone.

[^1]:  In Hawaiian there is a specific term for towards the top of the ubiquitous peaks which is 'mauka'. the other term is 'makai' meaning roughly, seaward. In this case I mean it to be Bay-ward, as sea-ward would technically be upslope. See: [[hawaiian terms for upslope and seaward - mauka and makai]] for more info.
